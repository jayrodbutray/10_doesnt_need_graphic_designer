# 10_doesnt_need_graphic_designer

## Code was created for this repository in order to allow a user to design a basic logo with the SVG file system for the shape, color and text.

### Credits go out to UC Berkley for their added help including and not limited to Robbert, our instructor and lots of Googling for a better understanding of tools not taught specifically in class.
